# Object-Array-Sorting---Java
This program was an assignment for my Intermediate Java 
class. The goal was to create a TextBook class which 
stores the Author, Title, Page Count, ISBN, and Price 
for TextBook objects. A secondary TextBook sorting class
is created to allow the user to sort an array of objects
based on the criterion provided by the user.
